# Coded chars

This crate's goal is to implement the ECMA-48 standard for coded characters in rust.

Various constructions are provided to easily add control character and sequences inside text.
This crate is compatible with "ANSI terminals".

This crate does not use a concept of "styles" or any kind of abstraction other than ones defined in the standard.

### Standard implemented

- [ecma-48](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48/) - Control Functions for Coded Character Sets

### Documentation

[On docs.rs](https://docs.rs/coded-chars/latest/coded_chars/)

### Current status

This crate is still in active development.

The API shall not change but a lot is yet to add.
