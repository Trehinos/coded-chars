# Coded chars

This crate's goal is to implement ECMA standards for coded characters in rust.

Various constructions are provided to easily add control character and sequences inside text.
This crate is compatible with ANSI terminals.

This crate does not use concept of "styles" or any kind of abstraction other than ones defined in the standards.

### Standards implemented

  Extension Techniques
- [ecma-43](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-43/) - 8-Bit Coded Character Set
  Structure and Rules
- [ecma-48](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48/) - Control Functions for Coded
